## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end machine learning system** designed to support finance teams by:

1. **Predicting expected freight cost** for vendor invoices.
2. **Flagging high-risk invoices** that require manual review due to abnormal cost, freight, or operational patterns.

The system is built on real procurement data stored in a SQLite database, trained using scikit-learn pipelines, and deployed through a Streamlit web application — accessible to non-technical users with no coding required.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

### 1. Freight Cost Prediction (Regression)

**Objective:**
Predict the expected freight cost for a vendor invoice using invoice value and historical behavior.

**Why it matters:**
- Freight is a non-trivial component of landed cost.
- Poor freight estimation impacts margin analysis and budgeting.
- Early prediction improves procurement planning and vendor negotiation.

### 2. Invoice Risk Flagging (Classification)

**Objective:**
Predict whether a vendor invoice should be flagged for manual approval due to abnormal cost, freight, or delivery patterns.

**Why it matters:**
- Manual invoice review does not scale.
- Financial leakage often occurs in large or complex invoices.
- Early risk detection improves audit efficiency and operational control.

## 🗂️ Data Sources

Data is stored in a relational SQLite database (`inventory.db`) with the following tables:

- `vendor_invoice` — Invoice-level financial and timing data
- `purchases` — Item-level purchase details
- `purchase_prices` — Reference purchase prices
- `begin_inventory`, `end_inventory` — Inventory snapshots

SQL aggregation is used to generate **invoice-level features**.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA focuses on **business-driven questions**, such as:

- Do flagged invoices have higher financial exposure?
- Does freight scale linearly with quantity?
- Does freight cost depend on quantity?

Statistical tests (t-tests) are used to confirm that flagged invoices differ meaningfully from normal invoices.

- `Predicting Freight Cost.ipynb`
- `Invoice Flagging.ipynb`

## 🤖 Models Used

### Freight Cost Prediction

| Model | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Linear Regression | Parametric | Baseline — fast and interpretable |
| Decision Tree Regressor | Non-parametric | Captures non-linearities, `max_depth=5` |
| Random Forest Regressor | Ensemble | Best generalization, `max_depth=6` |

> ✅ Best model selected automatically by **lowest MAE** on the held-out test set.

---

### Invoice Risk Flagging

| Model | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Random Forest Classifier | Ensemble | Tuned with GridSearchCV, `class_weight='balanced'` |

**Hyperparameter Search Space:**

| Parameter | Values Tested |
|---|---|
| `n_estimators` | 100, 200, 300 |
| `max_depth` | None, 4, 5, 6 |
| `min_samples_split` | 2, 3, 5 |
| `min_samples_leaf` | 1, 2, 5 |
| `criterion` | gini, entropy |

> ✅ Best model selected by **F1-Score** across 5-fold cross-validation (1,080 total fits).

**Risk Label Logic — an invoice is flagged if either condition is true:**
- 💰 **Dollar Discrepancy:** `|invoice_dollars - total_item_dollars| > $5`
- ⏰ **Delivery Delay:** Average receiving delay across PO lines `> 10 days`

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

### Freight Prediction
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score

### Invoice Flagging
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Classification report
- Feature importance analysis

---

## 🖥️ End-to-End Application

A **Streamlit application** demonstrates the complete pipeline:

- Input invoice details
- Predict expected freight
- Flag invoices in real time
- Provide human-readable explanations

| Module | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Freight Cost Prediction | Invoice dollar value | Predicted freight cost ($) |
| Invoice Risk Flagging | Invoice qty, dollars, freight, total PO qty, total PO dollars | ✅ Safe for Auto-Approval / 🚨 Manual Approval Required |

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- pip
- VS Code or any terminal

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imakash665/vendor-invoice-risk-intelligence-system.git
cd vendor-invoice-risk-intelligence
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib streamlit
```

### 3. Train the Models

> ⚠️ Run all commands from the **project root directory** in order.

```bash
# Step 1 — Train freight cost regression model
python freight_cost_prediction/train.py

# Step 2 — Train invoice risk classifier (may take 10–20 mins)
python invoice_flagging/train.py

# Step 3 — Optional: smoke test inference
python inference/predict_freight.py
```

### 4. Launch the App

```bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser at **http://localhost:8501**

> 💡 Steps 1 and 2 must complete before launching the app — the app loads `.pkl` files at startup.
